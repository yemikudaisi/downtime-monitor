# Downtime Monitor (Nettus)

A cross-platform desktop app for monitoring network services (e.g website's, email) up time. Desgined for display in small server room monitoring where visual/sound notification takes precedence. Previously developed in Electron, it is now being developed as a Tauri app. Note that the current version is a work in progress and not fit for use.
